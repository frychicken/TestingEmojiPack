I use affinity designer for these emojis, but photoshop is more popular so I have *.psd files. 

In addition, I don't know how to make animation using affinity designer. Therefore, I use photoshop to make those animations.

You can use *.psd to generate either video file or gif (gif does not work very well imo). 

## NOTE:

```emojiPack.psd``` is deprecated; it is not up-to-date as the newer version exceed maximum upload limit. 

Use ```emojiPack.afdesign``` instead; you can export as ```.psd```. 

I use ```emojiPack.psd``` mainly for generating transparent file.
