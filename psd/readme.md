I use affinity designer for these emojis, but photoshop is more popular so I have *.psd files. 

In addition, I don't know how to make animation using affinity designer. Therefore, I use photoshop to make those animations.

You can use *.psd to generate either video file or gif (gif does not work very well imo).
