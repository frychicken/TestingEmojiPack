I use affinity designer for these emojis, but photoshop is more popular so I use psd file. 

In addition, I don't know how to make animation using affinity designer. Therefore, I use photoshop to mke those animations.

You can use .psd to generate either mp4 or gif (gif does not work very well imo).
